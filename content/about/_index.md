**I’m based in Utah and have been self-taught in Swift/SwiftUI for four years, continuing to develop in Swift on Xcode.** I’m proficient in Swift and have experience with SQL, CSS, HTML, Python, Objective-C, and TypeScript. I’m also detail-oriented, with a background in facilities management, customer service, and technology. I collaborate effectively in fast-paced environments, solve problems, and deliver high-quality results.

In **August 2019**, I began working as a **Kitchen Porter at The French Kitchen** (August 2019 – January 2020), where I handled food preparation, dishwashing, and cooking cleanup. From **June 2021** to **August 2022**, I served as an **Inshopper at Jimmy John’s**, making sandwiches, cleaning, providing customer service, and learning to manage inventory. During that time, I also finished my **Brigham Young University Independent Study High School** education in **August 2022**.

Shortly after, I enrolled at **Utah State University** (August 2022 – April 2023) and then continued my studies at **Brigham Young University** (April 2023 – September 2023). While attending BYU, I worked as a **Facilities Specialist at the Missionary Training Center** (May 2023 – September 2023), overseeing facilities management, campus-wide logistics, and accurate delivery of supplies and equipment.

In **October 2024**, I began working as a **Lead Generation Specialist at Hammond Greetings & Promotions**, conducting research and analysis of company websites to identify potential leads and curating a targeted list of high-quality prospects for cold calling. Concurrently, from **November 2024** to **January 2025**, I served as a **Driver Helper at UPS**, assisting with package delivery and pickup while further developing my skills in logistics, customer service, and time management.
